<h1>Rail Busters</h1>


<p>The game is a top down shooter with a character that is on railroad rails.
  The main character is a minecart and there are 5 rails on the screen.
  The character moves and jumps across rails avoiding obstacles, and shooting enemies that appear on the screen.
  The main character is only able to shoot forwards, and the objective of the game is for the character to continue moving
  forward to get a high score.

Technical Components: I ended up using GameMaker Studio 2 for my game engine. Everything else is done from scratch.
The game is focused on the AI with the robot enemy performing actions based on the current state of the game which includes the player, score,
current location in comparision to the player, the amount of damage taken, and the required cooldown requirements.
